    <div id=id8>
     <div id=id9>Whether you’re looking for inexpensive speakers for a multi-room audio system, or high-performance home theater speakers that don’t<br/>
       take up any real estate in your room, Klipsch in-wall speakers provide the performance you require.

      In-wall speakers are easy to install and virtually invisible. Paintable speaker grilles mean that you’ll barely notice that you even have <br/>
      speakers in your room.
      
      Klipsch in-wall speakers also use the same horn-loaded technology as the traditional Klipsch speakers, and many are specifically designed to <br/>
      perfectly match an existing loudspeaker product, so feel free to mix and match in-wall speakers with you favorite Klipsch loudspeakers for the<br/>
       ultimate sound system.

           others depend on Bluetooth to transmit audio data to the receiving speaker.[1]
