    <h2 id=id7>Smart Speakers :</h2>
    <div id=id8>
     <div id=id9>A smart speaker is a type of speaker and voice command device with an integrated virtual assistant that offers interactive actions and<br/>
       hands-free activation with the help of one "hot word" (or several "hot words"). Some smart speakers can also act as a smart device that utilizes<br/>
        Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other protocol standards to extend usage beyond audio playback, such as to control home automation devices. This can include, <br/>
        but is not limited to, features such as compatibility across a number of services and platforms, peer-to-peer connection through mesh networking, <br/>
        virtual assistants, and others. Each can have its own designated interface and features in-house, usually launched or controlled via application<br/>
         or home automation software.[1] Some smart speakers also include a screen to show the user a visual response.

        <h2 id=id7>Surround Speakers :</h2>
        <div id=id8>
         <div id=id9>Surround sound is a technique for enriching the fidelity and depth of sound reproduction by using multiple audio channels from speakers <br/>
          that surround the listener (surround channels). Its first application was in movie theaters. Prior to surround sound, theater sound systems commonly<br/>
           had three "screen channels" of sound, from loudspeakers located in front of the audience at the left, center, and right. Surround sound adds one or <br/>
           more channels from loudspeakers behind the listener, able to create the sensation of sound coming from any horizontal direction 360° around the listener.<br/>
            Surround sound formats vary in reproduction and recording methods along with the number and positioning of additional channels. <br/>
             sound specification, the ITU's 5.1 standard, calls for 6 speakers: Center (C) in front of the listener, Left (L) and Right (R) at angles of 60° on either<br/>
              side of the center, and Left Surround (LS) and Right Surround (RS) at angles of 100–120°, plus a subwoofer whose position is not critical.

         <div id=id9>
          
          A soundbar, sound bar or media bar is a type of loudspeaker that projects audio from a wide enclosure. It is much wider than it is tall, partly <br/>
          for acoustic reasons, and partly so it can be mounted above or below a display device, e.g., above a computer monitor or under a home theater or <br/>
          television screen. Basically, in a soundbar multiple speakers are placed in a single cabinet, which helps to create surround sound and/or stereo <br/>
          effect. A separate subwoofer is typically included with, or may be used to supplement,[1][2] a soundbar.
