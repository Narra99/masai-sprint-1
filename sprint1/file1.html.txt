    <h2 id=id7>Sub Woofers:</h2>
    <div id=id8>
     <div id=id9>A subwoofer (or sub) is a loudspeaker designed to reproduce low-pitched audio frequencies known as bass and sub-bass,<br/>
       lower in frequency than those which can be (optimally) generated by a woofer. The typical frequency range for a subwoofer<br/> 
       is about 20–200 Hz for consumer products,[1] below 100 Hz for professional live sound,and below 80 Hz in THX-approved systems.<br/>
       Subwoofers are never used alone, as they are intended to augment the low frequency range of loudspeakers that cover the higher frequency<br/> 
       bands. While the term "subwoofer" technically only refers to the speaker driver, in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer<br/>
        driver mounted in a speaker enclosure (cabinet), often with a built-in amplifier.<br/>

      Subwoofers are made up of one or more woofers mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air<br/>
       pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures come in a variety of designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent),<br/>
        using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle,<br/>
         horn-loaded, tapped horn, transmission line, bandpass or isobaric designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency,<br/>
          low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external <br/>
          amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.[4]</div>

         <div id=id9>A loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer;[1] a device which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.<br/>
          The most widely used type of speaker in the 2010s is the dynamic speaker, invented in 1924 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice. The dynamic <br/> 
          speaker operates on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone, but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an <br/> 
          alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a<br/> 
           permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually <br/> 
           conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves. Besides this most common method,<br/> 
            there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound<br/> 
             recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an audio power amplifier before the signal is sent to the speaker

        <div id=id8>
         <div id=id9>Computer speakers, or multimedia speakers, are speakers sold for use with computers, although usually capable of other audio uses,<br/>
           e.g. for an MP3 player. Most such speakers have an internal amplifier and consequently require a power source, which may be by a mains power <br/>
           supply often via an AC adapter, batteries, or a USB port. The signal input connector is often a 3.5 mm jack plug (usually color-coded lime <br/>
           green per the PC 99 standard); RCA connectors are sometimes used and a USB port may supply both signal and power requiring additional circuitry, <br/>
           and only suitable for use with a computer). Battery-powered wireless Bluetooth speakers require no connections at all. Most computers have <br/>
           speakers of low power and quality built in; when external speakers are connected they disable the built-in speakers. Altec Lansing claims to <br/>
           have created the computer speaker market in 1990.
